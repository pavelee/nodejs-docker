# Linux Docker

Container with latest ubuntu version.

Great to test, install wierd packages. After fun you can simply clear containers.

## Run project

run project by simply

```
docker-compose up -d
```

then you can access container by command

```
docker exec -it linux-docker bash
```

**Use catalog playground to files between container and your pc.**

Enjoy!
